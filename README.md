Reinforcement Learning implementation for improving localization of GPS data
Project descriptionAn implementation of improving localization accuracy of the GPS coordinates is done using reinforcement learning model. The proposed reinforcement learning model learns an optimal strategy to make “corrections” on raw GPS observations. The model uses an efficient confidence-based reward mechanism and is constructed using the asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) algorithm and its performance is compared with extended Kalman filter. It is implemented with Python, TensorFlow.
